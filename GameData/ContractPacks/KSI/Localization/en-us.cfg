		// shared contract strings
		#KSI_contracts_notes = Complete the following:
		#KSI_contracts_synopsis = Search for gravity waves.
		#KSI_contracts_launchsatellite = Launch a science satellite
		#KSI_contracts_newVessel = Launch a new vessel
		#KSI_contracts_partValidation = Gravity Wave Detector must be available in tech tree
		#KSI_contracts_orbit = orbit
		
		#KSI_LISA_runExperiment = Run the gravity wave experiment and wait 7 days before collecting the results
		
		// contract homeworld gravity wave experiment
		#KSI_LISA1_title = Search for gravity waves above @targetBody
		#KSI_LISA1_genericTitle = Search for gravity waves above home world
		#KSI_LISA1_description = Launch a satellite with a gravity wave sensor into a high polar orbit near the edge of @targetBody 's SOI and run the experiment to listen for gravity wave events.
		#KSI_LISA1_genericDescription = Launch a satellite with a gravity wave sensor into a high polar orbit near the edge of our home world's SOI and run the experiment to listen for gravity wave events.
		#KSI_LISA1_Completed = You have collected a lot of data for our scientists to analyse.

		// contract other planet gravity wave experiment
		#KSI_LISA2_title = Search for gravity waves above @targetBody
		#KSI_LISA2_genericTitle = Search for gravity waves above another planet
		#KSI_LISA2_description = Our scientists would like to compare results from other planets. Launch a satellite with a gravity wave sensor into a high polar orbit near the edge of @targetBody 's SOI and run the experiment to listen for gravity wave events.
		#KSI_LISA2_genericDescription = Our scientists would like to compare results from other planets. Launch a satellite with a gravity wave sensor into a high polar orbit near the edge of a planet's SOI and run the experiment to listen for gravity wave events.
		#KSI_LISA2_completed = The probe has collected a lot of data and our scientists are keen to compare it to the data from around HomeWorld().

		
		// contract solar gravity wave experiment
		#KSI_LISA3_title = Search for gravity waves from a solar orbit
		#KSI_LISA3_description = Launch a satellite with a gravity wave sensor into a high polar orbit around the sub and run the experiment to listen for gravity wave events. This contract can be done twice. Once from north of the ecliptic and once south of the ecliptic.
		#KSI_LISA3_completed = The probe has collected a lot of data and our scientists say it looks a lot clearer than the data they got from around Kerbin. They will start analysing it immediately.
		#KSI_LISA3_launchSatellite = Launch a solar science satellite
