		// Atomic fountain
		#KSI_AF_title = Atomic fountain (Caesium 133)
		#KSI_AF_description = An atomic fountain is a cloud of atoms that is tossed upwards by lasers in a gravitational field. If it were visible, it would resemble the water in a fountain. While weightless in the toss, the atoms are measured to set the frequency of an atomic clock.
		#KSI_AF_tags = experiment research clock atomic fountain
		
		#KSI_AF_experimentActionName = Analyse the difference of time.
		#KSI_AF_reset = Reset analysis of the difference of time.

		#KSI_AF_ExperimentTitle = Atomic Fountain Clock Measurement

		#KSI_AF_ResultDefault1 = You precisely calibrate your clock frequency against the caesium atoms in the fountain.
		#KSI_AF_ResultDefault2 = You compensate for a slight variation in your clock frequency.
		#KSI_AF_ResultDefault3 = Excited caesium atoms tell your clock how to tick.


		// Dark matter collector
		#KSI_DMC_title = Dark matter collector
		#KSI_DMC_description = This is a dark matter collector.
		#KSI_DMC_tags = experiment material research science 

		#KSI_DMC_experimentActionName = Collect dark matter

		#KSI_DMC_experimentTitle = Dark Matter Collection Experiment
		#KSI_DMC_ResultDefault1 = The WIMPS are gently coaxed into the collector.
		#KSI_DMC_ResultDefault2 = There were too many MACHO particles to collect very much dark matter.
		#KSI_DMC_ResultDefault3 = The dark matter barely interacts with the collector at all.

		// Darl matter sensor
		#KSI_DMS_title = Dark matter sensor
		#KSI_DMS_description = Dark matter has never been directly observed; however its existence would explain a number of otherwise puzzling astronomical observations. The name refers to the fact that it does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation, such as light, and is thus invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Although dark matter has not been directly observed, its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational effects such as the motions of visible matter, gravitational lensing, its influence on the universe's large-scale structure, on galaxies, and its effects on the cosmic microwave background.

		#KSI_DMS_experimentActionName = Analyse dark matter.
		#KSI_DMS_reset = Reset the Analyse.

		#KSI_DMS_ExperimentTitle = Search for Dark Matter

		#KSI_DMS_ResultDefault1 = After searching carefully you're still in the dark about dark matter.
		#KSI_DMS_ResultDefault2 = You are fairly sure that the WIMPS are hiding from you.
		#KSI_DMS_ResultDefault3 = Some MACHO particles hit your detector after it was turned on.

		// Gravity wave sensor
		#KSI_Grav_title = Gravity Waves Sensor
		#KSI_Grav_description =  This part detect the change of the gravity of a planet with the modulation of the gravity waves.
		#KSI_Grav_tags = science experiment gravity waves

		#KSI_Grav_ResultDuna1 = Wow that was a big one!
		#KSI_Grav_ResultSunNorth1 = Very few events were observed
		#KSI_Grav_ResultSunSouth1 = Several large events were observed
